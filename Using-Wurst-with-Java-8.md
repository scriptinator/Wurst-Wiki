# Method 1: Install Java 8 properly
1. [**Download Java 8**](http://java.com/download) from Java.com.

2. **Install it.** If you need help with that, read the [installation guide](http://java.com/en/download/help/index_installing.xml) on Java.com.

3. **Uninstall all older Java versions.** Java.com has a [tutorial](http://java.com/en/download/faq/remove_olderversions.xml) on this as well.

4. **Done!**

# Method 2: Use the new Minecraft launcher
>#### WARNING: Only use this if method 1 fails!
>This method will not remove any of your old Java installations. Keeping them installed is **highly insecure**!

1. [**Download the new Minecraft launcher**](https://launcher.mojang.com/download/Minecraft.exe) from Mojang.com.

2. **Install it.**

3. **Done!** This launcher has the latest Java 8 built-in, so it will never attempt to launch Wurst with an old version.

# Method 3: Get Windows
Only Mac users get problems with old Java versions, Windows users don't.

1. [**Get Windows.**](http://windows.microsoft.com/)

2. **Done!**

Also, now that Microsoft owns Mojang, Minecraft will soon be integrated into Microsoft HoloLens (see picture below). Windows 10 will then be required to play Minecraft. It will be awesome...
