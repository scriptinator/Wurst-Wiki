BookHack allows you to insert links that execute commands into writable books. The nice thing about it: No one can see that it's a link, so you can trick admins into executing `/op <your_name>`, `/pex user <your_name> add *`, etc.

# Usage
1. Craft a writable book.
2. Type some text into it. Preferably a URL so that people will click on it.
3. Click `Sign` and give it a title.
4. Click `Command Link` and type in your command.
5. Click `Done`.
6. Give it to the admin or to the person you want to troll.

# Troubleshooting
- **You need Minecraft 1.8** on the server. Servers that run Minecraft 1.7 do not support books with links.

- **It's not patched.** Spigot is very slowly working on a patch, but they are nowhere near it. All others (Bukkit, Mojang, etc.) don't even care about it.
